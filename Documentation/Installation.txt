Symphony Installation
=====================

Installing Symphony on a rig
----------------------------

To run Symphony on an e-phys rig you need the following items installed:

* Windows 7 (32 or 64 bit)
* MultiClamp Commander
* Symphony .NET Framework (available from http://download.physionconsulting.com/)
* MATLAB 2011a (32 bit)
* Symphony UI (available from https://subversion2/murphylab/CodeRepository/trunk/Symphony)

For 32 bit Windows 7 you also need:

* HEKA ITC-18 drivers (32 bit)

For 64 bit Windows 7 you also need:

* HEKA ITC-18 drivers (64 bit)

Using Symphony with 64 bit Windows has not been extensively tested.  It is recommend to stay with 
32 bit at this point.
