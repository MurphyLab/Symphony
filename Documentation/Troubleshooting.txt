Troubleshooting Symphony
========================

Debug logs
----------

The Symphony .NET framework keeps log files containing debug information.  These files are placed in a directory named "debug_logs" in the 
directory above the StartSymphony.m file.  These log files contain information about communicating with the MultiClamp commander, etc.


Switching hardware
------------------

If you change the Heka or MultiClamp hardware connected to a rig then you will need to type the following into the MATLAB command window:

>> rmpref('Symphony', 'HekaBusID');
>> rmpref('Symphony', 'MultiClamp_SerialNumber');

The next time you run Symphony you will be asked to identify the new hardware.


Reset to default preferences
----------------------------

If you are experiencing a problem and nothing else will solve it then you can try resetting to the default preferences.  Close all Symphony 
windows and then type the following into the MATLAB command window:

>> rmpref('Symphony')
